                            arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Ordinary people
                            cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy,
                            resulting in the birth of Curses, a race of spiritual beings whose primary
                            desire is to bring harm to humanity.Jujutsu Sorcerers are people who control the flow of

                            out to search and uncover the One Piece treasure, but no one ever found the location of Gol
                            D. Roger's treasure, and the Grand Line was too dangerous a place to overcome. Twenty-two
